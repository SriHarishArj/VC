Hi I am Sri Harish

I made this document while learning Version control using git

git init --> to initialize git which helps to track, etc..,

Staging area: to track the file, bring the file to staging area
command: git add <filename.ext>

git status --> to check which files are in staging area and which are not like that

git commit --> to commit the version



Branching and Merging

Branching means creating a branch from the master branch so that we can test/do code changes in that branch without affecting the main branch that is master branch.

Once we satisfy with our work, we can merge the works done in the new branch to the master branch
