Hi I am Sri Harish

I made this document while learning Version control using git

git init --> to initialize git which helps to track, etc..,

Staging area: to track the file, bring the file to staging area
command: git add <filename.ext>

git status --> to check which files are in staging area and which are not like that

git commit --> to commit the version



<<<<<<< HEAD
Branching and Merging points (In Master branch):
1. git branch <branch name> --> to create a branch
2. git branch --> to check in which branch we are
3. git checkout <branch name> --> to switch/change the branch

To merge the changes from the branch (let say from Branch A to master), switch to master branch and use command git merge <branch name>
This merging will be added as commit in the master branch.


NOTE: We can create branches and add commits there and we can merge branches
=======
Branching and Merging

Branching means creating a branch from the master branch so that we can test/do code changes in that branch without affecting the main branch that is master branch.

Once we satisfy with our work, we can merge the works done in the new branch to the master branch
