Hi I am Sri Harish

I made this document while learning Version control using git

git init --> to initialize git which helps to track, etc..,

Staging area: to track the file, bring the file to staging area
command: git add <filename.ext>

git status --> to check which files are in staging area and which are not like that

git commit --> to commit the version
