Hi I am Sri Harish

I made this document while learning Version control using git

git init --> to initialize git which helps to track, etc..,

Staging area: to track the file, bring the file to staging area
command: git add <filename.ext>

git status --> to check which files are in staging area and which are not like that

git commit --> to commit the version



Branching and Merging points (In Master branch):
1. git branch <branch name> --> to create a branch
2. git branch --> to check in which branch we are
3. git checkout <branch name> --> to switch/change the branch

To merge the changes from the branch (let say from Branch A to master), switch to master branch and use command git merge <branch name>
This merging will be added as commit in the master branch.


NOTE: We can create branches and add commits there and we can merge branches
