Git three parts

1. Working directory
2. Staging area
3. Local repository


Initialize local repository using git init command.


Files will be moved from Working directory to staging area and from staging area to local repository (on commit)

From Working directory to Staging area --> git add . (. represents all files)
From Staging area to Local repository --> git commit -m "give any save point message"

git logs --> to see the commit logs

git diff <filename> --> to see the changes from previous version


git checkout <filename> --> to revert the file to last saved version

We have seen how to use version control using git locally
