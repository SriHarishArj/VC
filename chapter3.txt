I am chapter 3


Command for creating remote:
git remote add <remote name> <remote repository url>
Eg: git remote add orgin https://github.com/SriHarishArj/VC.git
NOTE: Maintain the naming convention: Orgin


To push local repository files to remote repository:
(to push all the commits)
git push -u orgin master

here,

orgin is what your remote repository is called
master is the branch. Which is a default branch or main branch for all the commits. Will cover more about branching later
-u --> flag represents link between local repository and remote repository
