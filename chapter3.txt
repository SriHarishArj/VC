I am chapter 3


Command for creating remote:
git remote add <remote name> <remote repository url>
Eg: git remote add orgin https://github.com/SriHarishArj/VC.git
NOTE: Maintain the naming convention: Orgin


To push local repository files to remote repository:
(to push all the commits)
git push -u orgin master

here,

orgin is what your remote repository is called
master is the branch. Which is a default branch or main branch for all the commits. Will cover more about branching later
-u --> flag represents link between local repository and remote repository

You can have local repository completely in parallel with remote repository. check the differences between them.
You can also sync them so that they all the same
You can also sync them or push your local repository to your remote repository


In our case the local repository is the .git file that we got in our story directory

remote repository is the git directory that we have got inside our story directory and the remote repository is the git hub which hosts our code and host all of the changes that were made in between different commits

so, git push basically pushes all the commits from local to remote repository
